# Laptop Price Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict laptop prices based on features such as CPU, RAM, screen size, and more. It utilizes various regression algorithms to find the best model.

## Features
- Predict laptop prices using multiple regression algorithms.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between features and price.
- Data visualization to support analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (see Installation section)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. View results and evaluation metrics in the console output.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- KNN
